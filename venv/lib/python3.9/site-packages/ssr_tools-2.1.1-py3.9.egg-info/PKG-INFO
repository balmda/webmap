This is a module for generic python tools to accomplish routine tasks. 

## Create a virtual environment

- Open a new terminal. 
- navigate to your code/project directory.
- run: python -m venv venv
- run: source venv/bin/activate
- run: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Installation
ssr_tools can be installed using the below options:
- From the ssr_tools directory
- Github Installation
- From the release file

### Directly from Github
Python's pip utility can install directly from a Github repository, which is great when you want to install the latest and potentially most stable version of ssr_tools. If you have set up SSH access (recommended) on your computer follow the instructions for the SSH commands. If you don't have SSH setup (not a problem), simply follow the instructions for the HTTPS command. For both approaches, you will need to replace [git_branch_name] with the branch you are intending to install. For eample, if you want to install the `dev` branch, the ssh pip install will look like pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/Safe-Streets-Research/ssr_tools.git@dev

SSH access: pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/Safe-Streets-Research/ssr_tools.git@[git_branch_name]

HTTPS access: pip install git+https://git@github.com/Safe-Streets-Research/ssr_tools.git@[git_branch_name]

### Directory installation
You can install `sr_tools` directly from the  directory on your machine that stores the ssr_tools source code (`code/ssr_tools`). This is an easy way to install the package and most useful when you're working on local edits to ssr_tools. Note, you will want to do a fresh pull before installing to ensure you have the most up to date version of ssr_tools. 

The `pip` command looks like this:
`pip install -e /path/to/ssr_tools`

### Release file installation
You can install the ssr_tools package by downloading the latest (or most appropriate release) from Guthub here: https://github.com/Safe-Streets-Research/ssr_tools/releases. To install, provide the path to the source file via pip, like this:
`pip install /path/to/release/file.zip`

## Set up virtual environment
- open command line and navigate to your project coding directory. 
- once in the directory (ex: /Users/balmdale/code/p010_bpsa), type in `python -m venv venv` into your command line and hit enter
- a new directory with subfolders and files will be created to help you setup your virtual environment
- type in `source venv/bin/active` and hit enter
- type in `pip install -r requirements.txt` and hit enter
- now your virtual environment is setup! 
- You can select your venv kernel within VS Code
- if you uwant to run scripts or commands within the command line, you need to activate your venv bny navigating to the code directory and running `source venv/bin/active` again
