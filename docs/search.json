    "text": "There are many established ways to examine crashes to better understand traffic safety patterns. Hotspot analyses have long been used to address high crash locations by retrospectively identifying the greatest concentrations of reported crashes over a determined period of time. Hotspot analysis is a valuable method to visualize locations with historic crash issues, but it is less effective at identifying locations with latent crash risk factors. In this way, it can be described as reactive. Additionally, hotspots may be less effective for analyzing bicyclist safety if crash frequencies are low due to geographic sparsity, which can exacerbate issues related to regression to the mean. Conversely, a systemic analysis is effective for identifying roadways with risk factors for crashes, independent from their crash history. For example, a wide arterial with a 45-mph posted speed limit, high traffic volumes, no bike facility, and few trip-attracting land uses may not have any reported bike crashes. However, the roadway and operational characteristics of that arterial are associated with higher bicycle crash risk. The absence of crashes is therefore not a reflection of low crash risk, but a reflection of lack of exposure that hotspot analyses cannot adequately convey. Systemic analysis is largely proactive; it allows planners and engineers to find locations that may warrant safety improvements before crashes have occurred there.\n\nHigh injury networks strike a balance between entirely retrospective and entirely proactive methods. Using spatial patterns of crash history, a High Injury Network identifies areas on the road network where crashes have been concentrated in sequence. A stretch of arterial roadway with crashes occurring at every other intersection might not show up on a traditional hotspot analysis because no one location has multiple crashes happening in the same place. However, the pattern of crashes all along the corridor suggests a larger safety issue. Further, the entire corridor likely shares similar characteristics that could be addressed systemically – even the intersections along the corridor that have not yet had crashes.\n\nThis section describes the development of a statewide High Injury Network and the results of the related High Injury Network analysis. The High Injury Network was built from a standard sliding windows analysis, which measures severity-weighted crash density by mode along segments on the network."

    "section": "3.1 Data Overview",
    "text": "3.1 Data Overview\n\n3.1.1 Crash Data\nCrash, party, and vehicle data that were provided to the consultant team include reported crashes from 2018 through 2022 for crashes for all modes (pedestrians, bicyclists, other - personal conveyances, and motorists).\nAll crash data were processed by Safe Streets Research & Consulting (“Safe Streets”) and loaded into a Postgres database for additional analysis using Python, SQL, and R programming languages. The crash, party, and vehicle tables have a relational structure, which is common for storing crash data. For every reported crash, there is one crash record. The party and vehicle tables contain information for all the primary “actors” and their respective “vehicles” involved in the crash and have a many-to-one relationship – i.e., all relevant party records are matched via a case identification number to the one crash record. The party and vehicle tables contain information for each primary person and their “vehicle” such as age, sex, pre-crash action, injury severity, and vehicle characteristics. This structure is shown in xxxxx.  \nSafe Streets processed and restructured the crash data used in this analysis. New variables were calculated and assigned, and the quality of the data was assessed through a robust quality control process. All reported crashes were processed (not just VRU crashes), but only crashes that involved at least one VRU and at least one motorist are included in this analysis.  \nCrashes involving a person using a scooter (e.g., shared e-scooter or ADA assistive device) are defined in the State of Minnesota as pedestrian crashes. However, they are coded in MnDOT’s crash database as the unit type “Other – Personal Conveyance” rather than as “Pedestrian”. The “Other – Personal Conveyance” category also includes many modes that are not pedestrians, such as farm equipment (tractor, combine), all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, horse and buggy, and the like. There is no single coded field in the crash database that differentiates between pedestrians using personal conveyance devices and these other modes. A targeted effort was conducted to classify these crashes based on a keyword scan of officer narratives. While we could reliably differentiate these crashes from farm equipment based on this procedure, we could not consistently differentiate between mobility scooters and other devices used by people with mobility impairments and other types of scooters or pedestrian devices. As stated in the 2019 Pedestrian Safety Analysis, a long-term solution to facilitate routine analysis of these modes in Minnesota would be to update the crash form with a field to indicate the type of scooter or device involvement (e.g., e-scooter, kick-scooter, ADA assistive device, moped scooter) and retrain officers to utilize the new field to record accurate and detailed information for more streamlined analysis.\nCrashes that met one or more of the following criteria were removed from the study dataset during the data consolidation process (see cccccc for the number of crashes that met each criterion; crashes can meet more than one criterion):\n\nMotorist-only (non-VRU) – The research team received a complete crash database for the years of interest (2018-2022). Because the scope of this project is only to analyze vulnerable road users, crashes that do not include a bicyclist, pedestrian, or someone potentially using a personal conveyance device are excluded from the analysis.\nMissing coordinates - Crash location GPS coordinates were not available.\nFarm Equipment – The “unit type” is coded as “Other – Personal Conveyance” and the officer narrative includes the words “tractor”, “horse”, or “trailer.”\nToo far away from the street or along a private street - The geospatial location of the crash is greater than 300 feet from any street or the street was a private roadway.\nThe crash occurred in a parking lot – The location type recorded in the crash data is a parking lot.\nCrashes that involved only a bicyclist and no other road users are not included in the crash data."

    "section": "3.2 Injury Severity Assignment",
    "text": "3.2 Injury Severity Assignment\n\nThe officer-reported injury severity levels used in this analysis are specific to the most severely injured (MSI) road user involved in the crash. This injury severity is different than the reported MSI assigned to each crash record. In most cases, VRUs are the most severely injured victim involved in the crash. Using the victim-level severity helps improve accuracy of summarizing injury severities. It should be noted that research from the San Francisco Department of Public Health has documented reporting errors related to mis-coded injury severities, particularly for suspected serious injuries4, suggesting a need for some fluidity when discussing minor and serious injuries. This analysis does not have access to hospital records to verify injury severities stored in the crash data, so the results in this document reflect the best available data at the time. For reference, the injury severities recorded in the crash data and summarized in this analysis are defined as followed:\n\nK - Fatal: A fatal injury is any injury that results in death within 30 days after the motor vehicle crash in which the injury occurred. If the person did not die at the scene but died within 30 days of the motor vehicle crash in which the injury occurred, the injury classification should be changed from the injury previously assigned to “Fatal Injury.”\nA – Suspected Serious Injury: An incapacitating injury is any injury, other than a fatal injury, which prevents the injured person from walking, driving, or normally continuing the activities the person was capable of performing before the injury occurred. Also called “Serious Injury” or “Injury A”.

    "text": "3.3 Roadway and Contextual Data\nThe crash dataset includes many useful variables for analyzing VRU safety; however, detailed information about roadway conditions and nearby land uses is also necessary to provide a more complete understanding of the context in which crashes occurred and support future countermeasure selection. A robust data collection and consolidation process was conducted as part of the 2021 MnDOT Statewide Pedestrian Safety Analysis. Data from that effort was provided to the study team for use in this VRU assessment. Data collected during the Statewide Pedestrian Safety Analysis was re-processed using the same methods documented in the data collection section of the Pedestrian Safety Analysis. Please refer to the Statewide Pedestrian Crash Analysis5 for a detailed summary regarding data usage and limitations."
